Any changes to CSS should be placed within `assets/custom.scss` and custom JS code within `assets/custom.js`. Furthermore, if you want to place somewhere SCSS variables, use file `variables/variables.scss`. 

**Requirements**

* The component should be optimized for all sized devices starting at 320px width. 
* The component should be placed in standard sized container.
* Button should have bootstrap tooltip with random description

**Testing**

You can get extra points for pointing out solutions that won't work in IE11 with suggestions of how to resolve them â€“ no actual work is required to fix issues though.

## Workflow

1. Install all required dependencies - `npm install`
2. Start main gulp task - `gulp` - it will compile SCSS automatically after each change
