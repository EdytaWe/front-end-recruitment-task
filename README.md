# Front-end developer recruitment task

Hello üëãüèº braveheart. We are truely delighted to introduce you to a front-end developer recruitment task. It was designed to provide multiple layers of a feedback for our HR teams in the recruitment process. You will be asked to create a module based on a prototype ‚Äì on top of ability to code pixel perfect component optimized for all size devices, we will examine code quality, your english and documentation reading skills as well as usage of latest trends and technologies.

The task was divided into 3 levels ordered by their difficulty where level 1 is the easiest and level 3 is the most difficult. You will be told which level you are expected to accomplish, however we strongly recommend to start with the easiest one first as all levels are strongly dependnent on others. You will be able to reuse most of your code.

We really hope to see you shortly on board, good luck! ü§òüèº

## Module

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://ext-a0ff-github.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/component.png" alt="component"/><br/><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/spec/9981f5d9-8668-4cc6-526f-53b0e436b63e-efb0/">Go to Adobe XD Prototype</a></div>

**Level 1**

You are expected to create a module based on the prototype above. It is a pure approach to code using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4 only. On top of a pixel perfect component optimized for all size devices, you may get extra points for using relative lenghts, or image source sets.

**Level 2**

You are expected to use SCSS and Gulp in your development process. Everything was already set-up ‚Äì it is ready to start out of the box. On top of a pixel perfect component you may get extra points for optimizing bootstrap bundle or using bootstrap mixins and variables.

**Level 3**

You are expected to use Twig templating engine, SCSS and Gulp in your development process. This level has  a lot dependencies, so make sure you follow the instructions to start easily.
